        checks to see if data exists first. If data is null, false, undefined, or 0, && will
        say that it's false and it doesn't need to check the right side. It already knows that
        if one of the 2 things is false, then the whole thing counts as false. Therefore, we

          The ternary operator is like our "if statement". If the thing before the "?" is true, 
          then we do the thing in the 2nd part of the statement. You'll also need to include the 
          colon and then after that will contain the "else" branch. If I don't have an else branch
          then I can replace the ternary ("?") with &&. Something else we might want to do is
          have the else branch be something like a div that says loading. So when the api is pulling
          the information from NASA, it will momentarily show "Loading..." on the screen before
          rendering the NASA data information. This is how you can get the spinners on a page while
          you wait for the page to load (as long as you add them in.)
